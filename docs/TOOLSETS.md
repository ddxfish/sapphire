# Toolsets

Named groups of tools so you don't have to switch between memory and web for example, just use any tools you want in a set. Switch what abilities the AI has access to per-chat. Each of your personas may have a different toolset based on what they do.

## Usage

Use the UI to edit tool sets. Look in the sidebar for Toolset Editor. You can simply use the built-in files (memory for example), or you can create your own toolsets that combine tools from various files. 

## Quick switch

You can quick-switch the active toolset below the user chat input. Each chat/persona has its own toolset saved in the chat history file, so if you switch to another chat, it activates that toolset.
