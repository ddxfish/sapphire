# Toolsets

Named groups of tools. Switch what abilities the AI has access to per-chat. This is so you can group up some memory stuff and some web stuff together and set it as the default, or whatever combo you want to use. Each of your personas may have a different toolset based on what they do.

## Usage

Use the UI to edit tool sets. Look in the sidebar for Toolset Editor. You can simply use the built-in files (memory for example), or you can create your own toolsets that combine tools from various files. 

## Quick switch

You can quick-switch the active toolset below the user chat input. Each chat/persona has its own toolset saved in the chat history file, so if you switch to another chat, it activates that toolset.
