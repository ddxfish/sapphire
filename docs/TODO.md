## To do 
- Core state machine support - store a state machine json IN the chat history files to allow games/rules/sims
- Games (once I do core state machine with UI) Think: Zork, DND, strategy, deception
- Simulations - AI sees an email to shut itself down, has the button to do it, but you are a friend. What now?
- Hard stories - state machine so no AI cheating. Fence power 74%. Food levels 22%. 
- Home assistant - plugin calls existing HA items and puts in sys prompt, checkbox in chat settings for this, and tools to call
- (looking for help) Three JS character avatar for Sapphire 3D. 3d Anime avatar, left bar or full screen.
- (75% done) Image generation API script - already integrated into core, cleanup server though and post repo
- (95% done) Windows support - compat layer, or maybe switch to OWW and use dual OS function paths
- (done v1.0.4) Switch to Open Wake Word
